<p class="indent4"><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,</p>

<p class="dropcap">Among the several experiments communicated to
the society, during the course of the preceding
year, none seeming so much to engage your attention,
as those contained in the Paper, intituled, <i>The force of
fired gun-powder, and the initial velocity of cannon-balls,
determined by experiments</i>: with much pleasure therefore
I acquaint you, that, on account of the pre-eminence
of that communication, your Council have judged
the author, Mr. <span class="smcap">Charles Hutton</span>, worthy of the honour
of the annual medal, instituted on the bequest of Sir
<span class="smcap">Godfrey Copley</span> Baronet, for raising a laudable emulation
among men of genius, in making experimental
inquiries. But, as on former occasions, so now, your
Council, waving their privilege of determining the
choice, have acted only as a select number deputed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
you, to prepare matters for your final decision. I come
then, on their part, briefly to lay before you the state
of the <i>Theory of Gunnery</i>, from its rise to the time when
its true foundation was laid, in order to evince how
conducive those experiments may be to the improvement
of an art of public concern, as well as to the advancement
of <i>natural knowledge</i>, the great object of
your institution. And if, upon a review of the subject,
you shall entertain no less favourable an opinion of Mr.
<span class="smcap">Hutton</span>’s performance, than what your Council have
done, it is their earnest request that you would enhance
the value of this prize, by authorizing your President
to present it to our ingenious brother in your name.</p>

<p>Artillery (in the large acceptation of the
term) took place long before the invention of gun-powder.
We trace the art to the remotest antiquity,
since the Sacred Records acquaint us, that one of the
kings of Judah, eight hundred years before the Christian
æra, erected on the towers and bulwarks of Jerusalem
engines of war, the contrivance of ingenious
men, for shooting arrows and great stones for the defence
of that city<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. Such machines were afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
known to the Greeks and Romans by the names of
<i>balista</i>, <i>catapulta</i> and others, which had amazing
powers, and were not less terrible in their effects than
the cannon and mortars of the moderns. It appears
that the <i>balista</i> was contrived to shower volleys of darts
and arrows of a very large size upon the enemy, whilst
the <i>catapulta</i> or <i>onagra</i> (as it was otherwise called)
was fitted not only for that purpose, but for discharging
stones of an enormous weight; I might say <i>rocks</i>,
since some of them are reported to have weighed several
hundred pounds. Batteries composed of numerous
pieces of that kind of artillery, nothing could withstand.
Yet, if we are rightly informed, their sole principle of
motion consisted in the spring of a strongly-twisted
cordage, made of animal substances singularly tough
and elastic. These warlike instruments continued, not
only during the time of the Roman empire, but to the
12th and 13th centuries, as we find from history; nor
indeed is it probable that they were totally laid aside,
till gun-powder and the modern ordnance, attaining a
good degree of perfection, superseded their use. The very
intelligent commentator of <span class="smcap">Polybius</span><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> is of opinion,
that the military art rather lost than gained by the exchange<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
of the <i>catapulta</i> for the mortar: but however
that point may be determined in speculation, it is not
likely that the ancient <i>tormenta militaria</i> will ever be
revived; but that all nations will keep to the art of
gunnery and study how to improve it; that is, they will
adhere to a system of artillery, wherein the moving
power depends on the expansive force of gun-powder,
or of some other substance of a similar nature.</p>

<p>Upon the first application of this principle to the purposes
of war, nothing perhaps was less thought of
than to assist so empirical a practice by scientific rules;
for, however aiding in these matters the ancient mechanicians
might have been, who, like <span class="smcap">Archimedes</span>, had
invented or perfected some of the <i>balistic</i> machines, no
praise seemed now due to the mathematicians for either
the discovery or improvement of the new artillery. In
fact, we find the practice of the art had subsisted about
200 years, before any geometer considered it as one that
admitted a theory, or at least such a theory as was
grounded on geometry.</p>

<p>It seems but just to trace and commemorate the inventors
of the ingenious arts which furnish matter for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
discourses on these occasions; and not only the main inventors,
but even those who first turned their thoughts
upon the subject: for, though such men may not have
produced any thing perfect, yet they may have suggested
ideas to others of a less inventive, but of a more
executive genius, and who, unprovided with those
hints, would never have made any notable discovery.
I must therefore observe, that the <i>Italians</i> were the first
who emerged out of those thick clouds of ignorance and
barbarism which had so long overspread this quarter of
the world. They profited by the unhappy fate of Constantinople;
for by liberally receiving the learned emigrants
on that distressful occasion, they were largely repaid
by their arts and sciences, and still more abundantly
by their language, whereby they were enabled to read and
to translate those ancient manuscripts, which the Greeks
had saved out of the wreck of their country. The art
of printing, which was established soon after, was the
means of quickly disseminating those treasures of knowledge,
and concurred with the fall of the eastern empire
to form an epoch for the advancement of learning, unparalleled
in the annals of letters.</p>

<p>The end of the 15th century, and the whole of the
16th, were chiefly employed by the Italians in the study<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
and in the translation of the old Greek authors. The
geometry of the ancient Greeks, as well as the arithmetic
in numbers and species of the Arabians, were cultivated;
but both remained, as it were, sciences by themselves,
unassisting to, or at best but weak and reluctant
auxiliaries to the philosophy of the schools: and indeed
how could the abstracted doctrines of numbers and
quantities be strained to co-operate with a system, in
which neither the laws of motion, nor any but the superficial,
and often delusive properties of matter, were to
be met with? The genius of the Greeks, all acute and
brilliant as it was, had never been properly directed to
the interpretation of nature, and was indeed unfit (as
Lord Bacon pronounced) for a study that made so slow
and painful a progress, by re-iterated and varied experiments
and observations. It was no wonder then, if the
<i>mixed mathematics</i>, as they are called, descended to the
moderns in a state no-wise corresponding to the elegance
and certainty of those parts of the science which
were elementary and pure; and that those mixed parts
should have been found defective and erroneous, in proportion
(if I may so express myself) to the physical considerations
that were to be taken into the inquiry. The
imperfection of the ancients, with regard to natural<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
philosophy, was not perceived at that time; nay, at the
period we are treating of, the learned were firmly persuaded
of the contrary, and that all that was wanting
to be known concerning the laws of nature, and the
properties of matter, was to be taken either directly, or
by deduction, from the physics of <span class="smcap">Aristotle</span>. It was
not till the 17th century was somewhat advanced, that
men of science began to listen to Lord <span class="smcap">Bacon</span> and <span class="smcap">Galileo</span>,
the great founders of the experimental and the
true philosophy.</p>

<p>Mean while, in the beginning of the 16th century,
unqualified as the Italians then were for entering upon
physico-mathematical inquiries<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, they nevertheless
made the attempt, and in particular took the theory of
projectiles into consideration. Some imagined that a
body impelled with violence, such as a ball discharged
from a cannon, moved in a right line till the force was
spent, and that then it fell in another right line perpendicularly
to the earth. Upon this principle, absurd
as it was, we find one of the earliest authors grounding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
his whole theory of gunnery<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>; whilst others, dissenting
from his hypothesis, admitted only the straight
line, in which the ball moved for some time after coming
out of the piece, and that other straight line in
which it fell to the ground; but asserted that these two
were connected by a curve line, and that this curve was
the segment of a circle. <span class="smcap">Nicolas Tartaglia</span> of Brescia,
a mathematician of the first rank in those days,
and still celebrated for his improvements in algebra,
hath been supposed to be the author of this doctrine, no
less erroneous than the former, and for which two of his
books have been quoted<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. Those I have never seen;
but from another of his works, professedly written on
this subject, and translated into English under the title
of <i>Colloquies concerning the art of shooting in great and small
pieces of artillery</i><a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>, him I find, contrary to the opinion
of his contemporaries, maintaining that no part of
the track of a cannon-ball is in a right line, though the
curvature in the first part of its flight be so small, that
it needeth not to be attended to. But <span class="smcap">Tartaglia</span> is
far from supposing, that the line in question hath any
relation to a <i>parabola</i>, or to any regular curve. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
would seem then, that if this mathematician had at first
been so far mistaken, as to fancy that some part of the
course of a projectile was in a straight line, he had afterwards
changed his opinion, and was perhaps singular
in what he finally embraced.</p>

<p>From numerous instances one would imagine, that
in those days, so far were men of science from making
experiments themselves, that they even shut their eyes
against what chance would have presented to their sight.
For, whoever had minded the roving shot of an arrow,
the flight of a stone from a sling, or had attended to a
stream of water issuing from the spout of a cistern,
might have been convinced, that the path of every projectile
was in a continued curve, whatever little he
otherwise knew concerning the properties of that one.</p>

<p>But had the observation of the philosophers gone so
far, they had still been at a distance from the truth.
They might have perceived a likeness between the
track of those bodies in motion and a parabola, and concluded,
from analogy, that all projectiles delineated that
curve in the air; but they could never have realized
their conjectures by mathematical demonstration, without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
previously knowing the law of <i>acceleration</i> in falling
bodies: a discovery reserved for the next century,
and for <span class="smcap">Galileo</span><a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, one of the greatest ornaments of it.</p>

<p>It was he who first investigated the effects of <i>gravity</i>
on falling bodies, and upon that foundation demonstrated,
that all projectiles would move in a parabola in
a non-resisting medium. And as he made little account
of the resistance of the air, whose properties were then
imperfectly known, he proved that a ball shot horizontally
would, in its flight, describe half a parabola; and
when the piece had an elevation above the horizon, the
ball would describe a whole parabola, supposing it to
fall on the plane of the battery. By the same method
of reasoning he shewed, that whatever the ranges of the
projected body, or the elevations of the piece were, the
ball would still trace that curve line, of a greater or lesser
amplitude, by the time it descended to the level of the
place from whence it came.</p>

<p>Thus far went <span class="smcap">Galileo</span>, confining his projections to
the horizontal plane of the battery; but <span class="smcap">Torricelli<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></span>
his disciple soon after carried the theory farther, by
tracing the shot to its fall, whether that place was above
or below the plane; and still found, by geometrical deductions,
that it flew in a parabola of a larger or a
smaller amplitude, according to the angle of elevation
of the piece, and the strength of the powder.</p>

<p>Various and numerous had been the disputes in Italy
about the laws of motion in general, and especially
about those of projectiles, from the time the mathematicians
had begun the inquiry, till the publication of the
dialogues of <span class="smcap">Galileo</span> on that subject (a space of upwards
of a hundred years) but from that period, so
evident did his demonstrations appear, that all contest
ceased, and every man of science was convinced, that all
projectiles moved in the track which he had discovered.
For, as to the resistance of the air, which he had not
passed unnoticed (as <span class="smcap">Galileo</span> himself had been the first,
at least of the moderns, who started the notion of the
weight of the air and the pressure of the atmosphere)
yet so thin and so yielding did they esteem that fluid to
be, that they were assured it could occasion no sensible,
at least no material, deviation from that curve. As they
had the principle from <span class="smcap">Galileo</span>, so they believed themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
warranted by that respectable author, not to fear
from that cause any objection, which he himself had
suggested, but had removed. <i>Among these projectiles</i>
(says he) <i>which we make use of, if they are of a heavy
matter and a round form; nay if they are of a lighter
matter, and have a cylindrical form, such as arrows shot
from bows, their track or path will not sensibly decline from
the curve of a parabola</i><a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<p>Here then was the theory of gunnery laid, in appearance,
on the most solid foundation. And thus far
the Italians having proceeded, they seemed to have taken
leave, and to commit the subject to other nations, whose
greater power, or greater ambition, was more likely to
make them avail themselves of the perfection of a military
art, than their instructors. We had reason
therefore to expect, that a neighbouring state, intent
upon the advancement of the arts and sciences in general,
would not fail to give particular attention to
those that should appear most subservient to its grandeur.
Accordingly we find, that our sister-society of
that kingdom had not been many years established,
when an ingenious member of that illustrious Body, not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
questioning the soundness of the Galilean principle in
regard to projectiles, in the year 1677, proposed to the
academy, as a problem for the improvement of artillery,
how to direct a piece (suppose a mortar) so as to
make the shot fall where one had a mind; or in the
common expression, <i>to hit a mark</i>, the strength of the
powder being given<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. This thought met with general
approbation, and so far were the academy from raising
any difficulty about the obstruction which the air might
occasion to a body moving with so much velocity in it,
that we do not find the making experiments on that
head was considered by them as an essential step to the
solution; but that their principal geometers straightway
set about solving the problem as it had been announced
to them, some following one method, some another,
and all upon the supposition of a projectile moving in
the line of a parabola. But <span class="smcap">M. Blondel</span>, who had
been the proposer, and who more particularly had studied
the question, composed a large volume on the subject,
which he published a few years after<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>, under the
title of <i>L’Art de jetter les Bombes</i>; a performance much
celebrated at the time, and that continued in no small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
request long after, as containing, besides his own, the
labours of several other members of that society of the
most distinguished merit. So many, and such hands
concurring in framing this work, it was no wonder that
the learned throughout Europe were confirmed by it in
the Galilean theory; and the more as <span class="smcap">M. Blondel</span> had
obviated the only objection they supposed could be
made to it, the <i>resistance of the air</i>, which he had taken
care expressly to mention, and so to combat as to persuade
the reader, that the retardation arising from
that cause was so inconsiderable as to be of no account
in the practice.</p>

<p>This illusion about the small or non-resistance of the
air to bodies rapidly moving in it, was so prevalent at
the end of the last century, and in the beginning of the
present, that in the history of the Royal Academy for
the year 1707, we find their worthy and most accomplished
secretary, after taking notice of the joint labours
of so many able mathematicians concerned in <span class="smcap">Blondel</span>’s
publication, venturing to say, <i>it did not appear that
any thing was then wanting for the practice of the art</i> [of
Gunnery] <i>except perhaps perfecting the instruments for
pointing a cannon or mortar ... but that geometry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
had done its part, so to speak, with regard to practice</i>.
&amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>But far be it from our intention to relate the imperfections
of others, in order to raise ourselves by the comparison.
Candour requires of us not only to acknowledge,
that in this country, as to the point in question,
we did not surpass our neighbours; but ingenuously to
own that, on the contrary, we were perhaps more liable
to exception. For, some years before <span class="smcap">Blondel</span>’s work
appeared<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, a treatise was published by one of our
own artillerists, <span class="smcap">Anderson</span> (a person of eminence in
his profession) intituled <i>The genuine use and effects of
the gun</i>, in which the author strenuously supports the
Galilean theory; nor do we learn he was ever contradicted
among us, although he undertook to answer all
those who should make objections to it. Nay, when
he had an opportunity afterwards of making experiments
on the ranges of bombs, and by those trials was
assured that their flight was not in a parabola; yet so
far was he from ascribing the deviation from that figure
to the resistance of the air, that he had recourse to an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
hypothesis, repugnant to all the laws of motion, to salve
appearances, and to reconcile those experiments with
his former doctrine<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.</p>

<p>And did not Dr. <span class="smcap">Halley</span>, so long the ornament of
this society, communicate in the year 1686 a Paper,
which he calls <i>A discourse concerning gravity</i>, in which,
treating of the motion of projectiles, he says, that being
aware of the deflexion from the parabolic curve that
might be occasioned by the resistance of the air, he had
made some experiments, even with cannon-balls, to estimate
the force of that resistance; yet conclude, <i>That in
large shot of metal, whose weight many thousand times surpassed
that of air, and whose force is very great, in proportion
to the surface wherewith they press thereupon, this
opposition was not discernible</i>. And again, <i>Though in
small and light shot, the opposition of the air ought and must
be accounted for; yet in shooting great and weighty bombs,
there need be very tittle allowance made; and so these rules</i>
[those, to wit, grounded on the principle of <span class="smcap">Galileo</span>]
<i>may be put in practice to all intents and purposes, as if
this impediment</i> [the resistance of the air] <i>were absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
removed</i><a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. Such conclusions, which we now find to
be erroneous, were the less to be expected from so
eminent a person, as they argued too much haste to
finish a theory, that was to be made subservient to
present use.</p>

<p>It might indeed have been expected, that men of
science applying themselves to this study, would have
been sooner awakened to the consideration of the great
opposition of the air, by the <i>Principia</i> of <span class="smcap">Newton</span>, published
a little after this Paper of <span class="smcap">Halley</span>’s<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. For in
that excellent work the illustrious author had demonstrated,
that the curve described by a projectile, in a
strongly resisting medium, differed much from a parabola,
and that the resistance of the air was great enough
to make the difference between the curve of projection
of heavy bodies and a parabola far from being insensible,
and therefore too considerable to be neglected.</p>

<p>Have we not then less to plead for not attending to
the <i>Principia</i> of <span class="smcap">Newton</span> in this article<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>, than the mathematicians
of other nations, who, as M. de <span class="smcap">Fontenelle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></span>
observes<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>, partly from the difficulty of understanding
that concise and profound work, and partly
from a misapprehension of its tendency (which they
fancied was to revive the exploded doctrine of <i>occult
qualities</i>) were late in becoming acquainted with it?
But it is not so easy to account for their inattention to
<span class="smcap">Huygens</span>, a known and even then a much esteemed
author, and who indeed was second to <span class="smcap">Newton</span> alone
in science and in genius. For he in the year 1690
had published a treatise on <i>Gravity</i>, written in a popular
manner, wherein he gave an account of some experiments
he had made at Paris, and in the academy, by
which, as well as by mathematical investigations, he
was convinced of the truth of <span class="smcap">Newton</span>’s conclusions, in
regard to the great opposition of the air to bodies moving
swiftly in it; and, by consequence, believed that the
track of all projectiles was very different from the line
of a parabola<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.</p>

<p>But excepting <span class="smcap">Newton</span> and <span class="smcap">Huygens</span>, the learned
seemed universally to acquiesce in the justness and sufficiency
of the principles of gunnery invented by <span class="smcap">Galileo</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
enlarged by <span class="smcap">Torricelli</span>, confirmed and reduced
to system by <span class="smcap">Anderson</span>, <span class="smcap">Blondel</span>, <span class="smcap">Halley</span> and others;
and so far were the theorists, in that branch of science,
from suspecting any defect or fallacy in these principles,
that they seemed rather to reproach the practical artillerists,
for not profiting more by the instructions which
they had so liberally imparted to them. Nor do we
find that an apology was made for the empirical exercise
of the art, by any author of note in that line,
earlier than the sixteenth year of this century, when M.
de <span class="smcap">Ressons</span>, a French officer of artillery, distinguished
by the number of sieges at which he had served, by his
high military rank, and by his abilities in his profession;
when he, I say, thus qualified to bear testimony, presented
a <i>memoire</i> to the Royal Academy (of which he
was a member) importing, that <i>although it was agreed
that theory joined to practice did constitute the perfection
of every art, yet experience had taught him, that theory
was of very little service in the use of mortars. That
the work of M. <span class="smcap">Blondel</span> had justly enough described the
several parabolic lines, according to the different degrees
of the elevation of the piece; but that practice had convinced
him there was no theory in the effects of gun-powder:
for that having endeavoured, with the greatest precision,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
to point a mortar agreeably to those calculations, he had
never been able to establish any solid foundation upon
them<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>.</i></p>

<p>Thus, after the theory of gunnery had exercised the
genius of the learned for nearly two hundred years, and
for almost fourscore of that time had rested on fundamentals
which had never been contested, it was pronounced
at once to be almost intirely useless, and that
by one of the most competent judges. Now, whether
it were owing to the deference due to the authority of
that experienced artillerist, or to some other cause, I shall
not determine, but observe, that it appears not from the
history of the academy, that the sentiments of M. de
<span class="smcap">Ressons</span> were at this time controverted, or any reason
offered afterwards for the failure of the theory of projectiles
when applied to use. Nor can I pass unnoticed
the pause that ensued before any further attempts were
made to improve the theory of the art, either upon the
old principles or upon new ones, except by such authors
as seemed ignorant of this transaction, and who of
course were not sufficiently apprized of the inefficacy of
the properties of the parabola for directing practice.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
Or by those who were employed in speculatively investigating
the nature of the curve traced by a ball in the
air; a curve which began at last to be considered as one
deviating much from the line of a parabola. Or, finally,
by such as, having taken notice that <span class="smcap">Newton</span>’s ideas
had not been duly attended to, endeavoured to avail
themselves of them, and of some experiments that had
been made by others, for proving the great opposition
of the air to bodies of swift motion; but without ascertaining
the degree of that resistance, or enriching the
art by any practical rules<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.</p>

<p>Such was the unhinged state of this part of the
mixed mathematics, when within our memory Mr.
<span class="smcap">Benjamin Robins</span> took cognizance of it: nor could the
subject have fallen into abler hands, endowed as he was
by nature with a superior genius and unwearied application.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Robins</span> was deeply versed in geometry
and the doctrine of numbers; but he knew the limits
as well as the powers of both, and how insufficient they
were for establishing any theory where matter was concerned,
without preparing the way, by finding out the
physical properties of that <i>matter</i>, by many and varied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
experiments and attentive observation. Those who had
hitherto treated of the foundation of gunnery, by being
too forward in the application of their mathematics, had
in a manner hurt the credit of that admirable science.
They ought to have seen the necessity of minutely examining
every circumstance which could affect the
course of a projectile, besides that of gravity. Mr. <span class="smcap">Robins</span>
perceived the error of his predecessors in that inquiry,
and corrected it. Persuaded as he was from sir <span class="smcap">Isaac
Newton</span>’s <i>Principia</i> of the great resistance of the air to
bodies moving in it, and also of the uncertainty of the
force of gun-powder, and of the variations in the flight
of shot, occasioned by the unavoidable varieties in the
make of it, and in the make of the pieces of artillery
which discharged it; apprized, I say, of so many causes
of aberration, he justly concluded, that the foundation
here was at least as much an affair of physics as of geometry,
and that if the art of throwing bombs had not
been advanced by theory, it was not because the art admitted
of none, but because the theory which had
hitherto been devised had been both defective and erroneous.
He suspected that most of the writers on
gunnery had been deceived, in supposing the resistance
of the air to be inconsiderable, and thence asserting the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
track of all shot to be nearly in the curve of a parabola,
by which means it came to pass that all their determinations,
about the flight of projectiles of violent motion,
had declined considerably from the truth. But in order
to clear this point from every doubt, he found it necessary
to ascertain the force of gun-powder, and by that
step to estimate the velocity of the shot impelled by its
explosion. That being done, he proceeded to measure
the quickness of a musket-bullet, shot out of a given
barrel, with a given quantity of powder; and to confirm
the truth of his conclusions, he contrived a machine,
by which the velocity of a bullet might be diminished
in any given <i>ratio</i>, by being made to strike on a large
body of a weight justly proportioned to it; whereby
the swiftest motions, which otherwise would escape our
examination, were to be exactly determined by these
slower motions that had a given relation to them.
The machine was a large wooden pendulum, which
swung freely, but in so slow a manner, that its vibrations
could easily be counted, whatever was the celerity of
the bullet discharged against it. The thought was
simple, ingenious, and incontestably his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>He next inquired into the resistance made by the air
to projectiles of rapid motion, and which he discovered
to be much greater than had been supposed by any
writer on the subject; and indeed so great, that it was
manifest the curve described by any shot was very different
from a parabola, and consequently that all the
applications of the properties of that conic section to
gunnery were so erroneous as to be totally useless. For
by means of this pendulum, placed at different distances
from the mouth of the piece, he clearly demonstrated
how much a bullet, flying with a given velocity, would
gradually lose of that motion by the opposition of the
air: therein furnishing to the learned a signal and instructive
instance of the fallacy of the most specious
theories, that do not proceed hand in hand with experiments.</p>

<p>I should too much exceed the just bounds of a discourse
of this kind, were I to enter more minutely into
the system founded by Mr. <span class="smcap">Robins</span>, confirmed and improved,
as I find, by the labours of several of the learned
in foreign parts of great celebrity<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. I shall only add,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
that his performance well deserves the title he gives it
of <i>The new principles of gunnery</i>, since the author may
more properly be said to have invented a new science
than to have added to an old one. And I believe I may
venture to say, that no physico-mathematical disquisition
hath done more honour to this country, or to the age,
than the writings of Mr. <span class="smcap">Robins</span> on this subject, which
have been published, partly by this Society, partly by
himself, and partly since his death (in the collection of
his whole mathematical tracts) by his learned friend.</p>

<p>But though our worthy brother will ever be celebrated
for being the inventor of the true principles of
gunnery, yet it would be too flattering to his memory,
to say he had carried the theory of this art to perfection.
He himself was far from entertaining so high an opinion
of his labours; nay he expressly declared, that he
left some material points to be inquired into at more
leisure (which other occupations and his immature death
deprived him of) and he much regretted that he wanted
conveniency and opportunities for making experiments
on balls of a greater weight, than what he had used for
ascertaining the initial velocity of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>Much therefore are we indebted to Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutton</span>,
who, treading in the footsteps of the deceased, hath resumed
and prosecuted this last <i>desideratum</i>, and hath
shewn himself not unequal to so difficult an enterprize.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Robins</span>, for determining the initial velocity of shot,
arising from different quantities of powder, made use of
balls of about an ounce weight; whereas Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutton</span>,
for the same purpose, hath employed those of different
weights, from one pound to nearly three; or, in other
words, Mr. <span class="smcap">Robins</span> made trial with musket-shot only,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutton</span> with cannon-balls from 20 to about 50
times heavier. This was a considerable step gained in
a disquisition of that part of the science, in which the
resistance of the air and other circumstances were not
concerned; and where neither analogy alone, nor mathematical
deductions alone, nor the two combined,
were sufficient for establishing principles applicable to
the motion of cannon-balls, without making a new series
of experiments: and with what labour and judgment
these have been performed, you understood by the account
which Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutton</span> gave of them in his Paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>But should it now be inquired, what advantages may
be derived from Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutton</span>’s experiments, for the advancement
of the art of gunnery, and of philosophy in
general? I would reply, that as to the former it may be
sufficient to observe, that though the improvements be
only such as can be deduced from the force of fired
gun-powder; yet they are in a higher, more certain, and
in a more general manner, than what resulted from the
labours of Mr. <span class="smcap">Robins</span>; who indeed led the way, but
who made, as it were in miniature, those experiments
which Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutton</span> hath executed at large, and which
<span class="smcap">Robins</span> himself wished to have made, as well as others
who have considered the subject since his time. Now
these experiments, though made by Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutton</span> with
cannon-balls of a small size, may nevertheless form just
conclusions when applied to cannon-shot of the largest
size. And such conclusions inform us of the real force
of powder when fired, either in a cannon or a mortar,
impelling a ball or bomb of a given weight; that is, they
discover with what velocity a given quantity of powder
drives those projectiles in a second, or in any other
assigned portion of time. They also shew the law of
variation in the velocity arising from different quantities
of powder, with the same weight of metal, and likewise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
that law which takes place upon using balls of different
weights. Further, they point out the advantage
obtained by diminishing the windage in cannon, and
teach us how we may increase the weight of the shot
in the same piece, by making it of a cylindrical form,
instead of a spherical: by this device, a smaller ship
may be enabled to do the execution of a larger one.
And experiments of the same kind will also determine
the just length of cannon for shooting farthest with
the same charge of powder.</p>

<p>Lastly, it is from these experiments, or from others
that may be made after the like manner, we are instructed
how to answer every question relative to military
projectiles, except such as depend on the resistance
of the air to bodies moving swiftly in it. This indeed
is a consideration which leaves room for greater improvement
in the art, and for conferring fresh honours
on those, who, like Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutton</span>, shall have opportunities
and abilities for continuing and perfecting this
very curious and useful inquiry.</p>

<p>As to the advantages accruing to philosophy from
the labours both of Mr. <span class="smcap">Robins</span> and Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutton</span>, speak<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
they not for themselves? The sciences of motion and
pneumatics are promoted by them; and of what avail
their perfection would be for the farther interpretation
of nature, you need not be informed. In fine, we have
here before us, in these experiments, the surest test of
our advancement in true knowledge, which is, the improvement
of a liberal art, and the enlargement of the
powers of man over the works of creation.</p>

<p>Some however may think, that the objects of this
society are the arts of peace alone, not those of war, and
that considering how numerous and how keen the instruments
of death already are, it would better become
us to discourage than to countenance their farther improvement.
These naturally will be the first thoughts
of the best disposed minds. But when upon a closer
examination we find, that since the invention of arms
of the quickest execution, neither battles nor sieges have
been more frequent nor more destructive, indeed apparently
otherwise; may we not thence infer, that such
means as have been employed to sharpen the sword,
have tended more to diminish than to increase the number
of its victims, by shortening contests and making
them more decisive. I shall not however insist on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
maintaining so great a paradox; but only surmise, that
whatever State would adopt the Utopian maxims, and
proscribe the study of arms, would soon, I fear, become
a prey to those who best knew how to use them. For
yet, alas! far seem we to be removed from those promised
times, <i>when nation shall not lift up sword against
nation, neither shall they learn war any more</i>!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Here ended the President’s Discourse: after which he
turned to Mr. <span class="smcap">Hutton</span>, and said</i>,</p>

<p>You have heard, Sir, the account I have given of
the rise and progress of the <i>theory of gunnery</i>, and of
your improvement of it; a recital, which by no means
would have done either you or the subject justice, had
it been addressed to any other audience than to the present.
But as my intention was only briefly to recall to
the memory of these gentlemen what they knew of this
subject, antecedently to your Paper, and to remind them
of the result of your experiments, I flatter myself I have
said what was sufficient on the occasion; being now authorized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
by them to deliver into your hand this medal,
as the perpetual memorial of their approbation. And
let me add, Sir, that they make you this present with
the more cordial affection, as by your other ingenious
and valuable communications they are assured, not only
of your talents, but of your zeal, for promoting the interests
and honour of their Institution.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
